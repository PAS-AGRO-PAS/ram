## `ram` Package

This repository provides:

1. An R package **`ram`** for Resource Allocation Modeling using linear programming, featuring sensitivity analysis via `lpSolve::compute.sens = TRUE`.
2. A `{golem}`-based Shiny app with dynamic UI modes ("solve" & "builder"), interactive tables, visualizations, and export capabilities.

---

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("PAS-AGRO-PAS/ram")
```

Then load the package:

```{r}
library(ram)
```

---

## Quick Start: Launch the App

Use the unified launcher with mode control:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ram::run_app()                 # default "solve" mode
ram::run_app(mode = "builder") # explicitly launch "builder" mode
```

The app uses `with_golem_options()` to pass the mode correctly and initializes external resources (logo, theming) automatically.

---

## App Highlights

* **Dynamic theming** via `{bslib}` with brand-based colors and light/dark toggle.
* **Dynamic logo** adapts to theme and displays in the app header.
* **Solve Mode**: upload or edit CSVs, define objectives, run the LP, view results & sensitivity, and explore interactive plots.
* **Builder Mode**: define resources and activities on-the-fly, then export CSV or XLSX.

## Programmatic Usage Example

### Load the `ram` package:

```{r}
library(ram)
```

### Define the resources

```{r}
library(ram)
res <- define_resources(
  resources    = c("land","labor","nitrogen",
                   "oat_min","oat_max",
                   "barley_min","barley_max",
                   "lupin_min","lupin_max",
                   "fava_min","fava_max",
                   "pasture_min","pasture_max"),
  availability = c(15, 350, 500,   2,8,       1,6,       2,5,       1,3,       2 ,4),
  direction    = c("<=","<=","<=", ">=","<=", ">=","<=", ">=","<=", ">=","<=", ">=","<=")
)

res
```

### Define activity matrix

```{r}
tech <- rbind(
  land         = rep(1,5),
  labor        = c(20,25,15,30,10),
  nitrogen     = c(80,100,0,30,0),
  oat_min      = c(1,0,0,0,0),  oat_max = c(1,0,0,0,0),
  barley_min   = c(0,1,0,0,0),  barley_max = c(0,1,0,0,0),
  lupin_min    = c(0,0,1,0,0),  lupin_max = c(0,0,1,0,0),
  fava_min     = c(0,0,0,1,0),  fava_max = c(0,0,0,1,0),
  pasture_min  = c(0,0,0,0,1),  pasture_max = c(0,0,0,0,1)
)
colnames(tech) <- c("oat","barley","lupin","fava","pasture")

acts <- define_activities(
  activities = colnames(tech),
  activity_requirements_matrix = tech,
  objective = c(oat=400, barley=450, lupin=350, fava=500, pasture=360)
)
acts
```

### Build and solve the model

```{r}
model   <- create_ram_model(res, acts)
solution <- solve_ram(model, direction = "max")
solution
```

### View optimasition results

```{r}
print(solution$optimal_activities)
print(solution$objective_value)
print(sensitivity_ram(solution))
plot_ram(solution)
summary_ram(solution)
```

### 📝 Summary of Improvements

- Unified `run_app()` now respects `"solve"` or `"builder"` modes.
- Branding & light/dark theming via `{bslib}`.
- Dynamic logo integration in the header.
- Clear explanation of both interactive and programmatic interfaces.
- Emphasized new features like theme toggling, visualizations, and exports.
