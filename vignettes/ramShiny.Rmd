# Introduction

Welcome to the user manual for the **PAS-AGRO-PAS** Shiny application. This application was developed to optimize the allocation of agricultural resources and activities. This manual will guide you through the application's features and how to use them.

# Instructions for Use

## Templates & Upload

In the sidebar, you will find sections to download CSV templates and upload your own CSV files.

- **Download Templates**: Click the buttons to download the resource and activity templates.
- **Upload Files**: Use the inputs to upload your resource and activity CSV files.

## Add / Remove Rows

You can add or remove rows in the resource and activity tables.

- **Add Rows**: Click the "Add Resource" or "Add Activity" buttons.
- **Remove Rows**: Select a row in the table and click "Remove Resource" or "Remove Activity".

## Solve the Model

Set the objective (maximize or minimize) and click the "Solve Model" button to solve the optimization model.

# Features

## Resource and Activity Tables

The tables are interactive and allow direct editing. You can modify the values of availability, direction, and resource requirements.

- Resources
Define each constraint by row:
  - resource (e.g. land, labor, nitrogen or bound like oat_min)
  - availability (numeric)
  - direction (<= or >=)

- Activities
Each row is an activity (e.g. a crop) with columns:
  - resource coefficients (how much of each resource/unit)
  - objective (per-unit margin or cost)

## Optimization Results

After solving the model, you can view the results in the following tabs:

- **Optimal Solution**: Shows the optimal levels of each activity and the objective value.
- **Activity Plot**: Interactive plot with the optimal levels of each activity.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Shows how the results change with variations in parameters.

# Exporting Results

You can export the current data from the resource and activity tables as CSV files using the download buttons.
Download Table buttons appear above each interactive table.
Exports exactly what you see, in CSV form, ready for your records.
